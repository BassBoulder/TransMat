Transfer Blender Materials to Unreal

TransMat is an Add-on for Blender's Node Editor.

Once you have created your material, click the 'Transmat!' button.
This will create a python file with a list of instructions to recreate the material in Unreal.
Then, in Unreal (with the Python plug-in and Editor Scripting enabled) click File > Execute Python Script.
Navigate to the python file that was just created, and click OK - eg _yourmaterial_TM.py
